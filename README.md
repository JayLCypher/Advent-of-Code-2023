# Advent of Code 2023
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) is a set of coding challenges released per day of advent.
This is my solutions for select challenges throughout December of 2023.

It will also stand as a showcase of diving into several languages, many of which I had never tried before.

Enjoy!

## The Plan:
- Day 1 - Written in [C](https://www.iso.org/standard/74528.html). <- Success
- Day 2 - Written in [Big OCaml](https://ocaml.org). <- Failed...
- Day 3 - Written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). <- Success (After 2 days lmao).
- Day 4 - Written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org). <- Part 1 complete
- Day 5 - Written in [C++](https://isocpp.org). <- Part 1 complete
- Day 6 - Written in [D](https://dlang.org).
- Day 7 - Written in [M$ Java / C# / DotNET (Same thing)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp).

## Requests?
Sure, I'm not a creative person.
