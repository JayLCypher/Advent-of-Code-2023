# [Advent of Code Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3) - Rust

## The Task

```txt
--- Day 3: Gear Ratios ---
```

## The Solution

Build with Cargo, just do car go run, or cargo build -r then car go run for faster run.
Essentially, take three lines, apply a 3x3 matrix window. for part 1, check against a static u8 array and part 2 is just *.
Have fun!
